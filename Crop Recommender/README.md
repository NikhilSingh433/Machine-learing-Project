**Random forest**
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees


**Random Forest Classifier **

If the prediction task is to classify the observations in a set of finite labels, in other words to “name” the objects observed, the task is said to be a classification task.
It means the Random Forest classifier is used to predict the lable within in the data set, based on the training.


**Mathematics Behind the Random Forest Classifier**

For classification, as in the labeling iris task, linear regression is not the right approach as it will give too much weight to data far from the decision frontier. A linear approach is to fit a sigmoid function or logistic function, which is also known as Logstic regression
